# CGWeeklyChallenge01GTBC


## Description

This project focused on cleaning up and making the HTML and CSS code behind an exhisting webpage more accessible.

This was done by:

-Using semantic elements\
-Combining CSS selectors\
-Removing reduntant code\
-Leaving comments for future devs

This was done because:

-Accessiblity is important for people with disabilities\
-Search engines prioritise accessible websites\
-The code is easier for the next dev to work on\
